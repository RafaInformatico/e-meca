Typing speed practice plugin for Office Word.

Mainly oriented to improving typing speed for typewriting for public examination. It allows you to set a text model and a time to test your speed. It has countdown, error detection, end test alarm, and detailed scores with characters per minute.

The text to be written has to be printed as is not seen in the screen. You can open another window with the model but it will not be as similar to the real test.
